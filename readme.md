# Improving Candidate Generation for Low-resource Cross-lingual Entity Linking

This is the code repo for TACL 2020 paper [Improving Candidate Generation for Low-resource Cross-lingual Entity Linking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01343)

## Training
Please refer to [train.sh](https://github.com/shuyanzhou/pbel_plus/blob/master/train.sh) for the arguments, all four models (charagram, charcnn, lstm-last and lstm-avg) could be launched in this bash file

## Test
Please refer to [test.sh](https://github.com/shuyanzhou/pbel_plus/blob/master/test.sh) for the arguments, all four models (charagram, charcnn, lstm-last and lstm-avg) could be launched in this bash file

## Data
Data folder contains ``data`` ``alias`` and ``kb``
#### ``data``: data for train, dev and test
```
English_Wikipedia_ID ||| English_Wikipedia_title ||| Wikipedia_title_of_train/test_lang ||| Entity_type
e.g. 3378263 ||| John Michael Talbot ||| ጆን ማይክል ታልበት ||| PER
```
#### ``alias``: entity alias from Wikidata
```
Wikidata_ID ||| English_Wikipedia_ID ||| aliases
e.g. Q42 ||| 8091 ||| Douglas Adams ||| Douglas N. Adams || Douglas Noël Adams || Douglas Noel Adams
```

#### ``kb``: all entities in wikipedia (~2M, proper nouns)
```
English_Wikipedia_ID ||| English_Wikipedia_title ||| Entity_type
e.g. 16429160 ||| George Karrys ||| PER
```
Note that all files ended with .ipa are of *phoneme* representations, using [Epitran](https://github.com/dmort27/epitran)

## Model
under the models folder, we have:

``base_train``: the base class for training 

``base_test``: the base class for testing

``charagram``: character n-gram model, used in our work

``charcnn``: character CNN, used as baseline

``lstm``: used as baseline

## Utils
``to_ipa.py``: code for generating the phoneme representation of strings. 
## TODO
* Trained models
* Code to extract data from Wikipedia for any language and specify train/dev/test split
* Code to calculate n-gram
